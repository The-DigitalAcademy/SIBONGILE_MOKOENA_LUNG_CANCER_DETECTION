General Info

The objective of lung cancer detection is to develop a system or model that can accurately identify the presence of lung cancer or its likelihood based on certain input data or medical information. The detection system aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing lung cancer at an early stage, which can significantly improve patient outcomes and survival rates.

# Technologies used
The project leverages the following technologies and libraries:

Python

pandas

scikit-learn

NumPy

Jupyter Notebook (for data exploration and model development)

# Features
The dataset includes the following features:

Setup
To set up the lung Cancer Detection project , follow these steps:

Install the required software and libraries for Python. Clone the project repository to your local machine.

Import the dataset into Python Then perform analysis and do machine learning with python.

Usage
#Project status This project is currently in development.

Room for improvement
Feature selection: Identify and utilize the most relevant features for better model performance. Model selection: Experiment with various regression models to find the most suitable one for this specific challenge.
